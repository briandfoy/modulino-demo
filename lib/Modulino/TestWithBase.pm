=head1 NAME

Modulino::TestWithBase - A demonstration of module ideas

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module isn't meant for use. It's an example of the modulino idea
with an additional branch to recognize test situations then run as a
test file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I wrote this module as a demonstration of some ideas for I<Mastering
Perl>'s modulino chapter. This module loads Modulino::Base to handle
the modulino portions of the module.

In particular, this modulino has a special test more. If C<CPANTEST>
is a true value, it runs the module as a test file. That mode will
look for methods that start with C<_test_>.

This also handles the normal "run as application" modulino idea if the

sub _test_run {
	require Test::More;

	Test::More::pass();

	SKIP: {
		Test::More::skip( "These tests don't work", 2 );
		Test::More::fail();
		Test::More::fail();
		}
	}

Run all of the subroutines that start with C<_test_>. Each subroutine
is wrapped in a C<Test::More> subtest.
